                            <p>Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must 
                            develop novel and localised solutions that will curb this menace, hence the
                            birth of iReporter. iReporter enables any/every citizen to bring any form of 
                            corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the general public. 
                            Users can also report on things that needs government intervention</p>

                            <h2>WHAT EXACTLY IS CORRUPTION?</h2>
                            <p>In general, corruption is a form of dishonesty or criminal activity undertaken by a 
                            person or organization entrusted with a position of authority, often to acquire 
                            illicit benefit. Corruption may include many activities including bribery and 
                            embezzlement, though it may also involve practices that are legal in many countries.
                            Political corruption occurs when an office-holder or other governmental 
                            employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain. Corruption is most 
                            commonplace in kleptocracies, oligarchies, narco-states and mafia states.</p>
                            <p>Corruption can occur on different scales. Corruption ranges from small favors 
                            between a small number of people (petty corruption), to corruption that affects 
                            the government on a large scale (grand corruption), and corruption that is so 
                            prevalent that it is part of the everyday structure of society, including 
                         corruption as one of the symptoms of organized crime. Corruption and crime are 
                            endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually 
                            all countries on a global scale in varying degree and proportion. Individual 
                            nations each allocate domestic resources for the control and regulation of 
                            corruption and crime. Strategies to counter corruption are often summarized under
                            the umbrella term anti-corruption.</p>
